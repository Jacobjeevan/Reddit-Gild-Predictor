# Reddit Gild Predictor

## Objective:

Given a reddit comment, classify which gilding, if any, it would receive.

## Progress:

- 04/17: Data scraping completed (Initial)

- 04/18: Decided on continue scraping based on initial analysis due to higher than expected class imbalance (gilded vs non gilded comments).

- 05/03: Collected 1.5 million comments

- 05/10: Rerunning scraping due to a bug in the initial collection, as well as collecting more relevant features for future work.

- 05/19: Stopped scraping. Completed initial EDA.

- 05/20-21: Experimented with Logistic Regression Model (with Resampling). Check notebooks for progress.
